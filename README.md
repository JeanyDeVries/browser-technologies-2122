## Description
> I want to be able to design, save and order my own t-shirt-with-nerdy-text and be able to do this as well when I'm reopening the site. 
This is the user story of the assignment. I'm making this app accessible on as many 'standard' browsers. I will also let the app work without javascript and CSS for the people who turn this off. 
The main point of this assignment is to make it accessible for as many people. This means to make it work on many browsers and check if some features are supported or not plus make the core functionality work without javascript and css
